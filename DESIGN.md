# Dock-aware warehouse pre-positioning: a market whitespace with clear build paths

**No commercial product currently exists that does exactly what you've described** — an external, lightweight system that reads dock schedules and carrier appointments, correlates them with live inventory positions and pending orders, scores internal repositioning movements, and feeds executable tasks to AGVs or human forklift drivers. The building blocks are scattered across warehouse execution systems, slotting tools, and AMR orchestration platforms, but no vendor has assembled them into this specific product. The concept represents a genuine market gap at the intersection of dock scheduling and internal movement optimization — two domains the industry still treats as separate software categories. On the build side, a **hybrid architecture combining ML demand prediction, weighted scoring, and operations research optimization** is the most practical path, deployable in phases starting with a rules-based MVP in weeks and graduating to reinforcement learning over 12–18 months.

## The product landscape: close but nobody's there yet

Extensive research across major WMS/WES vendors, AMR orchestration platforms, slotting tools, startups, patents, and academic literature confirms this concept sits in a whitespace. Several products overlap with significant portions of it, but none combine all the pieces — external architecture, dock-schedule awareness, movement scoring, and task generation for existing equipment.

The **closest products by architecture** (external to WMS) include **CognitOps ALIGN**, which layers ML analytics on top of any WMS non-invasively ("it simply needs access to the WMS database") and whose co-founder explicitly described "positioning inventory" as a core question they answer. However, CognitOps is a decision-support and visibility platform — it tells managers what to do but doesn't generate machine-executable movement tasks for AGVs or forklifts. **Lucas Systems' Jennifer AI** explicitly "fills the gap between your WMS and control software" and can optimize full-pallet moves for outbound operations, but it lacks dock-schedule-aware pre-positioning logic. **GreyOrange's GreyMatter** orchestrates people, vendor-agnostic AMRs, and processes as an external AI layer generating up to **1 million optimizations per minute**, but it's a general-purpose orchestration engine rather than a dock-focused pre-staging system.

The **closest products by function** include **Softeon WES**, which can operate in standalone mode alongside any existing WMS, considers carrier cut-off times, generates tasks for both humans and automation, and integrates yard management with appointment scheduling. But Softeon is a full warehouse execution system managing all fulfillment processes — not a targeted pre-positioning optimizer. **Vecna Robotics' Pivotal** platform sits externally, integrates via WMS APIs, and generates movement tasks for autonomous pallet trucks, analyzing "shipping deadlines and customer requirements." The critical missing piece is proactivity: Vecna moves pallets when they're needed, but doesn't pre-stage them in anticipation of scheduled truck arrivals. **Blue Yonder's WES** explicitly "reduces backlogs at outbound loading by prioritizing tasks to clear the dock or staging area" and groups tasks by outbound load — perhaps the most functionally complete offering — but it's a built-in module requiring the full Blue Yonder ecosystem.

**Conveyco's New Dawn WES** deserves mention for explicitly advertising "directed put away to staging areas to minimize handling time" and "real-time optimized lane assignments for quick dock turnaround" while positioning itself as a WMS supplement. **Optricity** (now FORTNA) generates a "Moves Conductor" — a list of slotting moves — and works externally with any WMS, but it's a periodic batch re-slotting tool, not a real-time dock-aware engine. A newer entrant, **Optioryx**, formally defines the "Warehouse Optimization Software (WOS)" category as "an optimization layer on top of the WMS," validating the architectural pattern you've described, though their focus is slotting and picking rather than outbound pre-staging.

| Capability | CognitOps | Softeon WES | Vecna Pivotal | Blue Yonder WES | GreyOrange |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **External to WMS** | ✅ | ✅ (standalone) | ✅ | ❌ Built-in | ✅ |
| **Reads dock schedules** | ❌ | ✅ Cut-off times | ❌ Deadlines only | ✅ Full yard mgmt | ❌ |
| **Scores repositioning moves** | ❌ Advisory | ❌ Full WES | ❌ Task allocation | Partial | Partial |
| **Generates AGV/forklift tasks** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (core function) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Proactive pre-positioning** | ❌ | Partial | ❌ Reactive | Partial | ❌ |

## Patents and academic research validate the concept's value

The most relevant patent is **US10504055B2** (Boston Dynamics / X Development, 2016), which describes a system that receives real-time inventory and location data, identifies item shipment expectations including future delivery deadlines, determines an optimal layout using a **cost function** considering time-to-depletion, storage capacity, and shipment deadlines, and then decides whether to rearrange items "based on whether the time to rearrange is less than a threshold." It causes robotic devices to execute the rearrangement. This is architecturally very close to the described concept, though it's integrated into a WMS rather than external. **DHL's modular picking optimization patent** establishes prior art specifically for the external-observer pattern, describing a system "modular in nature, which allows the existing WMS to operate whether or not the optimization system is present."

The strongest academic validation comes from **Karimi, Zaerpour & de Koster (2024)** in *Transportation Research Part E*, which demonstrated that dynamic repositioning of product loads based on anticipated demand **reduces makespan by 14–30%** even though repositioning involves extra work. A 2025 paper in *Ain Shams Engineering Journal* proposed a deep RL framework (MTPPO) that jointly optimizes storage allocation and AGV dispatching, achieving **8.7–18% reduction** in transport/waiting time — crucially showing that jointly learning storage and scheduling outperforms optimizing each in isolation. Another 2025 paper introduced "progressive storage" based on "predictive guidance, progressive movement" — gradually moving inventory toward theoretically optimal positions during normal operations, which is conceptually identical to the described approach.

The **specific whitespace confirmed by research**: dock scheduling software (DataDocks, Veyor, GoRamp) manages carrier appointments but doesn't optimize internal positioning. Internal movement optimization tools don't consume dock schedule data. The two domains remain siloed in both commercial products and academic literature.

## Building it: the hybrid ML + OR architecture wins

The most practical and effective development approach combines **ML for demand prediction**, a **weighted scoring function** for movement prioritization, and **operations research for constrained optimization** — deployed in phases from simple to sophisticated.

**Phase 1: Weighted scoring MVP (2–4 weeks).** A linear scoring function combining known operational signals can deliver immediate value without any ML:

```
Score = w₁ × urgency + w₂ × distance_savings + w₃ × SKU_velocity + w₄ × order_priority + w₅ × dock_proximity
```

Where urgency uses exponential decay toward carrier appointment time, distance savings measures the gap between current and staged positions, and SKU velocity reflects ABC classification. Weights can be calibrated using **AHP** (Analytic Hierarchy Process) with warehouse operations managers, then empirically optimized via grid search against historical loading time data. A priority queue re-scores all candidate movements on trigger events (new order, appointment change, forklift availability). Research on dynamic importance-aware scheduling confirms this approach significantly outperforms static FCFS or fixed-priority methods.

**Phase 2: ML-enhanced prediction (4–8 weeks).** A **LightGBM** model predicts `P(SKU_i needed at bay_j in next N hours)` using features including historical demand patterns, order pipeline data from the WMS, carrier schedules, seasonality, and SKU characteristics. A 2024 ACM paper on warehouse demand prediction found LightGBM performed best among tested models (**R² ≈ 0.786**). The ML prediction feeds into the scoring function as a demand confidence signal. SHAP values provide interpretability — warehouse managers can see why SKU X was prioritized over SKU Y. Critically, research shows that for structured tabular data with fewer than 50 features, gradient boosting rarely outperforms simpler models by more than **2–3%**, so Phase 1's scoring function may already capture most of the value.

**Phase 3: OR-based optimization (6–12 weeks).** Given scored movements, solve the assignment and scheduling problem using **Google OR-Tools**. The pre-positioning problem maps to a capacitated assignment problem (which SKUs go to which staging locations) combined with a **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows** (how forklifts/AGVs execute the moves). OR-Tools' CP-SAT solver and routing library directly support these formulations. Published warehouse applications show OR-Tools achieving **33% reduction** in picker tour length and **83% reduction** in walking distance when combined with spatial clustering. The key insight from QuantumBlack/McKinsey's work on hybrid OR+AI: "ML excels at prediction (what will be needed), OR excels at optimization (how to execute given predictions)."

## When reinforcement learning makes sense — and when it doesn't

Deep RL and multi-agent RL are powerful but carry significantly higher development cost and risk. They should be reserved for Phase 4+ after the hybrid ML+OR system is operational and producing baseline metrics.

**Single-agent deep RL** (PPO or DQN) trained in a SimPy-based warehouse simulation can discover non-intuitive pre-positioning policies that rule-based systems miss. The state space encodes inventory locations as a grid, upcoming orders and dock schedules as temporal features, and AGV positions. Action masking enforces hard constraints (full locations, unavailable inventory, blocked aisles). Industry reports cite **20–40% throughput increases** from AI-driven dynamic slotting. However, RL requires millions of training episodes, an accurate simulation environment, and careful reward shaping. The sim-to-real gap — while less severe for warehouses than for contact-rich robotics — still demands domain randomization and progressive deployment with human override capability.

**Multi-agent RL (MARL)** becomes valuable when coordinating multiple AGVs that must avoid congestion at staging areas and dock doors. The most relevant research is **Krnjaic et al. (2023)**, who developed a hierarchical 3-layer manager/worker architecture for warehouses with heterogeneous agents, scaling to **19+ agents in medium warehouses** (240 item locations). Their TA-RWARE environment on GitHub (`uoe-agents/task-assignment-robotic-warehouse`) is the closest existing simulation to the pre-positioning use case, featuring heterogeneous agents, action masking, and Gymnasium compatibility. **MADDPG-IPF** (Li et al., 2021) achieved **47% task response improvement** for multi-AGV coordination using information potential fields for reward shaping.

**LLM-based agents** are an emerging option for strategic-level decisions (shift planning, exception handling) but are too slow for real-time AGV control. A practical hybrid: LLM as "warehouse strategist" setting hourly priorities, MARL system executing movements, OR solver ensuring constraint satisfaction.

| Criterion | Statistical/OR | Single-Agent RL | Multi-Agent RL |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Time to production** | 2–4 weeks | 3–6 months | 6–12 months |
| **Data requirements** | Historical orders, SKU data | Accurate simulation | Simulation + distributed training |
| **Interpretability** | High | Low | Very low |
| **Optimality ceiling** | Good (local optima) | Strong | Strongest (coordination) |
| **Production robustness** | Very high | Medium | Medium-low |
| **When it wins** | Stable demand, clear signals | Complex patterns, large state space | Many AGVs, coordination-critical |

## The open-source toolkit is surprisingly mature

Several frameworks directly support building this system. For RL training, **Ray/RLlib** is the primary recommendation — it supports multi-agent environments (MultiAgentEnv API), algorithms including PPO/QMIX/MAPPO, distributed multi-GPU training, and PettingZoo integration. **Stable Baselines3** provides clean single-agent implementations ideal for prototyping. For warehouse-specific environments, **RWARE** (`semitable/robotic-warehouse`) offers a configurable multi-agent warehouse with Gymnasium v2 compatibility, and **TA-RWARE** extends it with heterogeneous agents and hierarchical task assignment — directly applicable to pre-positioning. **Flatland-RL**, developed with Deutsche Bahn and SNCF for the NeurIPS 2020 benchmark, provides an analogous multi-agent logistics scheduling problem.

For simulation, **SimPy** is the recommended discrete-event simulation framework for building a custom warehouse digital twin — lightweight, Python-native, and easy to wrap as a Gymnasium environment for RL training. **Mesa** (v3.2 includes a warehouse example) supports agent-based modeling with grid/network spaces and browser visualization. For the OR layer, **Google OR-Tools** provides LP/MIP solvers, constraint programming (CP-SAT), and VRP routing — all directly applicable to the assignment and scheduling components.

A practical development stack: `SimPy (warehouse DES) → Gymnasium environment wrapper → Stable Baselines3 (prototyping) → Ray/RLlib (production MARL) → Google OR-Tools (constrained optimization) → ONNX export (production inference)`.

## Conclusion

This concept occupies a **validated whitespace**. The academic evidence is strong (14–30% makespan improvements from dynamic repositioning), the architectural pattern is proven (external optimization layers over WMS are an emerging category), and no competitor has assembled the specific combination of dock-schedule awareness, movement scoring, and external task generation. The closest competitors — Softeon WES in standalone mode and Vecna Robotics Pivotal — each cover roughly half the concept but miss critical elements.

The fastest path to a working system is the **phased hybrid approach**: start with a weighted scoring function and priority queue (deployable in weeks), layer in LightGBM demand prediction (adds 2–8 weeks), add OR-Tools for constrained optimization of staging assignments (adds 6–12 weeks), and pursue RL only after establishing baseline metrics and building a faithful digital twin. The key insight from both the academic literature and industry practice is that **ML prediction + OR optimization consistently outperforms either approach alone** — ML handles the messy pattern recognition of "what will be needed," while OR handles the precise constraint satisfaction of "how to execute it." Reserve MARL for large multi-AGV deployments where coordination between vehicles becomes the binding constraint, and maintain an OR-based fallback policy as a safety net throughout.

The **Boston Dynamics/X Development patent (US10504055B2)** is the most potentially relevant IP to evaluate, with its cost-function-based layout optimization driven by shipment deadlines — though its integration-into-WMS architecture differs from the described external pattern, and DHL's modular optimization patent establishes prior art for the external-observer architecture specifically.
